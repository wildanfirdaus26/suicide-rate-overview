## What is Suicide ?
Suicide is death caused by injuring oneself with the intent to die. A suicide attempt is when someone harms themselves with the intent to end their life, but they do not die as a result of their actions. Several factors can increase the risk for suicide and protect against it. Suicide is connected to other forms of injury and violence, and causes serious health and economic consequences.

## About This Project
In this small project, we will explore dataset about suicides rate from 1985 to 2016. This dataset is contains several variabels or columns that will be used as a reference in the process of extracting valuable information.

## Objectives
Unfortunately, not all information in the dataset will be explored in this project. However, we will try to set up simple information goals that will be the basis for working on this project. These objectives are :

1. Knowing the age group, gender, generation and year with the highest suicides in the world.  
2. Understanding simple statistics information from the age group, gender, generation and year with the highest suicides in the world.  
3. Knowing the country with the highest suicides.  
4. Knowing suicides by the age group, gender, generation and year from countries with the most suicides.  
5. Understanding simple statistics information from countries with the most suicides.
